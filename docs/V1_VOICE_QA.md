# Voice implementation and evidence — 2026-09-12

Implemented in this batch:

- Recent dialogue (six exchanges) retained per bot for the runtime connection;
  Clear conversation removes it. Reconnection does not restore this history.
- Sentence generation and synthesis overlap. Audio is decoded in arrival order,
  queued, and played through the same engine used for microphone interruption.
- Actual output amplitude drives the avatar mouth, including the greeting.
- Speech onset can cancel playback; captured interruption becomes the next turn.
- Stopped turns cannot deliver late audio. Pending sentence jobs skip cancelled
  turns; a synthesis already executing may finish internally before being discarded.
- Listening resumes only after server completion and all audio settles.
- Endpoint silence is 650 ms; this remains an energy-based detector, not semantic
  understanding of whether a sentence is finished.
- Balanced uses local qwen3.5:4b; Fast uses qwen3.5:0.8b. An explicit model
  environment setting overrides both. Models must already be installed.

Evidence:

- 87 JavaScript tests, including ordered decoding, stale decode cancellation,
  streamed sentence boundaries, and interruption onset with retained speech.
- Production build passes (existing bundle-size warning remains).
- Runtime smoke and recorded speech input integration passed.
- `node scripts/test-voice-dialogue.mjs` passed six spoken turns: Nova recalled
  mango from the previous turn, a two-sentence fixture produced two WAV chunks,
  and Sterling, Rivit, and Luma each returned valid audio.
- Native Electron inspection: two-sentence reply returned to Listening and Send;
  a longer streamed story showed Speaking with mouth movement; pressing Stop
  returned immediately to Listening. Chat controls fit within the display after
  reserving vertical expansion space at launch. This is visual/state evidence,
  not a subjective audio-quality rating or real-microphone interruption test.

Still unqualified: extended real-microphone noisy-room interruption, all target
hardware, and subjective naturalness. Per-sentence speed/emotion remains basic;
authored laughs/breaths/backchannels, pitch control, semantic endpointing, and
persistent memory are not implemented. These are not implied by passing tests.
